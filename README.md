# Lattices-in-Idris
Trying to prove Knaster-Tarski theorem in Idris

## Definitions given
1. Partial order
2. Type of subtypes of a type
3. Lattice 
4. Complete lattice
5. Monotonic function
6. An order on the type of monotonic functions on a partial order

## Propositions proven
1. Order on the monotonic functions is reflexive
2. Order on the monotonic functions is transitive
