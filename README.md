# Lattices-in-Idris
Trying to prove Knaster-Tarski theorem in Idris

## Definitions given
1. Partial order
2. Type of subtypes of a type
3. Lattice 
4. Complete lattice
5. Monotonic function
6. An order on the type of monotonic functions on a partial order
7. Pre and post fixedpoint, and fixedpoint
8. Highest pre-fixedpoint
9. 

## Propositions proven
1. Order on the monotonic functions is reflexive
2. Order on the monotonic functions is transitive
3. For two monotonic functions f and g is f \\leq g and 
   g \\leq f then (f a) and (g a) are equal for all a. 
   Notice this does not imply that f = g.
4. Highest Prefixedpoint is also a fixedpoint
